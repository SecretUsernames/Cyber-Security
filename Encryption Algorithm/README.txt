Main will read in all argument inputs if fitting the correct parameters such as "./Assignment1 S test.txt output.txt key.txt E"
Entering "make" into the terminal will compile the program, then use the example above to execute the program.
Using S will encrypt the program using Stream Cipher method from input file to outputfile using key file.
To decrypt using stream cipher, use same terminal command but with the output file swapped to the input and a new output file stream
Block cipher is executed similar to stream cipher but B for first argument and mode set to either E or D. For decrypting
the encrypted file, do the same thing as you did for stream cipher with swapped the output files and switched the mode to D.
